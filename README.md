# Blockchain

Trying to learn more about blockchain technology by building one from the ground up.

Will try to implement signing, transactions (and blocks), mining, broadcasting, etc. 

## Language (changed 06/02/2022)

UPDATE: Will use typescript instead for simplicity of implementation.

Using Java bc have to use it for my algo class next year.
